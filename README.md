# Description
Project is created as part of [Rust learing course](https://www.coursera.org/programs/kharkivs-kii-natsional-nii-univiersitiet-radioieliektroniki-learning-program/specializations/rust-programming) to get used to basics in code syntax, IO operations and error handling
Code reads file which provided as a line argument and echoes each line with it's positional number

# Build and run

cargo run <file_name>
```

# Original Rust template

_This template repository is part of a 4-week Rust course, [start on week 1 here](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) if you want to learn more about Rust!_

This Rust template is meant to help you get quickly started with a new project. It is [Codespaces enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) and it is pre-configured with useful extensions like the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) and [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart)

This repository is configured as a GitHub Template, so that you can start fresh with a new repository without carrying the history and commits of this repository. To get started you can click on the "Use this template" green button, or follow this [link directly](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template/generate)

This is the Rust template used as part of the [Rust Bootcamp](https://s.deza.pe/zjo). There are 4 weeks in total:

- [week 1](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) 
- [week 2](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-fundamentals)
- [week 3](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-structs-types-enums/)
- [week 4](https://github.com/alfredodeza/applied-rust)
- [Rust Template](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template) ðŸ‘ˆ You are here!
